== File structure

Mappings are organized into three types of files. The model mapping is the vanilla
mapping that describes the transformation between an archetype and an un-profiled resource.
This is the most basic form of mapping that is to be shared and maintained by the communities.

Extension mappings are used to extend model mappings by adding, overwriting, or
appending mapping logic to the vanilla model mappings. This is required to map
between templates and profiles. The model mappings act as a sustainable set of base
mappings that can be extended for a given scope using extension mappings. Extension
mappings act similarly to a String Builder.

Context mappings define the import of model mappings and extension mappings,
specifying what profile is transformed into which template and with which mapping
file to start. There is one context file required for each profile and template mapped.
From a developer's perspective, they act as an import and main.

== The header

The header is contained in each FHIRconnect mapping file. It is
standardized for both FHIRconnect and
https://github.com/SevKohler/OMOCL[OMOCL].

An example of a model mapping header:

[source,yaml]
----

engine: FHIRConnect/v0.0.1  # what grammar and version is used in this file
type: model  # the type of mapping: model, extension or context
metadata:
  name: ACTION.informed_consent.v0  #the name of the mapping
  version: 0.0.1a # version of this particular mapping
spec: # schema specific to the FHIRConnect v0.0.1 engine
  system: FHIR  # What is mapped
  version: R4
  openEhrConfig:
    archetype: ACTION.informed_consent.v0 # what openEHR archetype is mapped in this model mapping
  fhirConfig:
    structureDefinition: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Consent # to what FHIR structureDefinition this is mapped
----

An example of a extension mapping header:

[source,yaml]
----
engine: FHIRConnect/v0.0.1
type: extension
metadata:
  name:  KDS_anatomical_location
  version: 0.0.1a # version of this particular mapping
spec: # schema specific to the FHIRConnect v0.0.1 engine
  system: FHIR
  version: R4
  extends: CLUSTER.anatomical_location.v1 # the name of the model mapping that is to be extended
----

Example of a context mapping header:

[source,yaml]
----
engine: FHIRConnect/v0.0.1
type: context
metadata:
  name:  KDS_diagnose.context
  version: 0.0.1a
spec:
  system: FHIR
  version: R4
----

Naming conventions are as follows: Names of model mappings always start with the type of openEHR
class (e.g., EVALUATION) and the full name and version. Sometimes it happens that two resources
can be transformed into one archetype. In this case, the name of the mapping is to be extended
with what FHIR type is mapped to what openEHR archetype:

* CLUSTER.medication.v2 (this maps medication-to-medication)
* CLUSTER.medication.v2.substance-to-medication (this does not map a
FHIR medication but an FHIR substance)

This allows for separately calling these archetype mappings for different use cases. The initial one
created always stays as `CLUSTER.medication.v2` and is to be seen as the default. All future mappings
created that also map to medication but from another FHIR input must add a string to their name as
described above. We deem the first mapping as the default one. Furthermore, we want to prevent
dependency problems by renaming the file later on. For extension and context mapping names,
there is no specific style guide, as this is a project-specific decision users have to make.
