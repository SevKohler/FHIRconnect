:navtitle:  Bundles

FHIR-data is typically send in Bundles and contains references. These have to be processed in a specific way.


== Bundles
Bundles contain a collection of resources, the FHIRconnect engine needs to split these Bundles into smaller
collections in order to process them. The context mapping files contain a list of profile urls. Using this list
the engine needs to split these into processable bits.

In this example we have two context files provided, one for Diagnose and one for Procedure, the engine
splits this Bundle into two separate ones, to be processable.

Sometimes resources are contained as part of a mapping, but also are related to a mapping themselves.
The Encounter in the example could also be a mapping to encounter in openEHR, yet its also referenced by
the Diagnose A. For this linked mappings are used, see xref:types-of-mappings/concept-mappings.adoc[]. The
Diagnose would link the mapping to Encounter and therefore, triggers apart from its own mapping,
the encounter mapping.
