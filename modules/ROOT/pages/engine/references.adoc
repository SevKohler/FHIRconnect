:navtitle:  References

When a reference is provided in a resource and not contained in the Bundle, the engine should attempt to
GET it form the sending site. If not possible, the engine proceed with the mapping. To prevent circular
dependencies in FHIR, the mapping engine should either stop at a given level of references or keep track
which ones where already resolved.
