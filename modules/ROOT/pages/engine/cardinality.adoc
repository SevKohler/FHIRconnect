= Cardinalities
:navtitle:  Cardinalities

We encounter different cardinalities in elements that are to be mapped. These can be fixed by changing the model.
Sometimes this is not possible. FHIRconnect always acts depending on the cardinality of something.

When a 0..n field is mapped into a 0..1 field, the last element is maintained. All other ones are to
be overwritten by their predecessor.

If we map an element into a list element, also from another mapping, it's always appended to the list
and does not overwrite the entire list.
