:navtitle: Cardinalities

We encounter different cardinalities in elements that are mapped.
These can sometimes be adjusted by modifying the model.
However, this is not always possible.

FHIRconnect always behaves according to the cardinality of the elements.

When mapping a `0..n` field to a `0..1` field, only the last element is retained.
All preceding elements are overwritten by their successors.

If an element is mapped into a list element, even from another mapping,
it is always appended to the list rather than overwriting the entire list.

#GASPER, is this correct? I don't remember 100%.#

== When to Fail a Mapping

It is recommended that the engine enforces strict rules when mapping elements.
Since the mapped data is clinical data, maintaining maximum semantics and data coverage is a top priority.

For example, if we have a parent node with a `1..1` cardinality and a child node with a `1..1` cardinality,
the mapping should fail if the child is not provided.

A more tolerant approach would be to map only the parent, ensuring that at least some data is transformed.
However, since we cannot determine what data is missing, either all data should be mapped,
or the mapping should fail.
