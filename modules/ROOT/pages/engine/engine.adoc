= Requirements of the Engine
:navtitle: Engine

What needs to be done by the engine, the grammar implies. ## Validation

== Resolving of EHR id and patients

== Missing references


== mapping fields that are not part of the template

Engine should not execute mappings that are not required by the
template/kick them out.


== writing into 0..++*++ fields

E.g. mappings from a 0..++*++ dosage that contains a route into the
openEHR route which is 0..n. Field is added for each cluster again and
again. if its 0..++*++ append, if its 0..1 overwrite. Mapping to List in
openEHR should always append to list e.g. /links.

== mappings and multiple codings

codeable concept transform use term mappings vice versa
