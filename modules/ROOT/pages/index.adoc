== About FHIRconnect


FHIRconnect is a derivative of YAML and a rework of the draft from
Betters https://github.com/better-care[FHIRconnect]. It is used to
bidirectionally map openEHR and FHIR. The aim is to create a mapping
language the communities can use to transform between the standards.

Apart from the transformation the specification and resulting files
should also deal as a documentation of how these things are to be
mapped. So even if vendors do not implement FHIRconnect, they have a
documentation of how this is should be transformed. This is especially
important to maintain a consistency between transforming both standards
throughout institutions.
