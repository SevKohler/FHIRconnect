:navtitle: Mapping types

There are different types of mappings, in general most of it is autoresolved by the engine with
dynamic typing. We can enforce types if we want to by using the `type:` key in the `with:` clause.

There are two categories of types, one are data types these are primitive mappigns
that transform one data element into another.

Then there is the category of concept types that are used for everything that does not directly transform
two data types into each other.
