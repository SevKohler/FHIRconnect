= Mapping types
:navtitle: Mapping types

There are different types of mappings, in general most of it is autoresolved by the engine, since FHIRconnect
has no static typing. We can enforce types if we want to by using the `type:` key in the `with:` clause. Typically, you
will find this in use for `type: NONE` if you just want to iterate a path.
The types are:

* NONE
* QUANTITY
* DATETIME
* CODING
* STRING
* IDENTIFIER
* HIERARCHY
* PROGRAMMED
* REFERENCED

##@Gasper what else do we have if we want to static type ? i dont like we add this but we have too...
##
##Can you write here how you process these in the engine ? Like data type mappings
##

== Programmed mappings
Sometimes the FHIRconnect specification grammar is not enough and a mapping requires a very unique logic. For this the
Programmed mappings where introduced. Here a bit of code can be referenced that is executed by the engine. The way how
this code is provided and where is up to the vendor.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "dosageTiming"
    with:
      fhir: "$fhirRoot.timing"
      openehr: "$archetype"
    # type: "PROGRAMMED" not necessary, mappingCode is unique for PROGRAMMED_MAPPINGS
    mappingCode: "timingToDaily_NonDaily" #FHIR and openEHR are here very different, openEHR uses ISO, FHIR made up their own
----


== Referenced mappings
A composition could not contain an archetype (difference to slotArchetypes) to represent a specific resource in FHIR.
This composition can be another one to the one that is currently mapped. To redirect a part of the FHIR data
to a different FHIRconnect mapping the `$REFERENCED_MAPPING` can be used. Hereby, the engine needs to checks
the `meta.url` contained in the FHIR resource and search the available FHIRconnect context mappings. If a context mapping
for this `meta.url` is contained, it is executed and saved as a separate composition. This composition is linked using the
openEHR https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/common.html#_link_class[links]. The fields of this
link are set in the `openEHRLink`.

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: "partOf"
    with:
      fhir: "$resource.partOf.reference"
      openehr: "$reference"
    reference:
      mappings:
        - name: "partOfReference"
          with:
            fhir: "$fhirRoot"
            openehr: "$archetype/links" # will use link
            # type: "REFERENCED" not necessary due to dynamic typing (openehrLink is unique for Referenced...)
          openehrLink:
            meaning: "Part of referenced event"
            type: "partOf"

== Hierarchy Mappings

Hierarchy mappings are the most complex type of mappings.
Sometimes, the hierarchy between a FHIR and an openEHR model does not align properly.
For example, elements may exist on different levels in the models, leading to complications.

A good example of this is the FHIR `MedicationStatement`.
Without delving into the details of why the models are structured differently, there are several challenges to address.


In FHIR, the `timing.event` contained within the `dosage` element
(see https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.r4.core/4.0.1/files/80817[MedicationStatement])
maps to the `dateTime` of the `EVENT` in openEHR.
Therefore, if there are three `dosages` in FHIR with different `timing.event` values,
three separate `EVENT` elements must be created in the openEHR
https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.4949[medication_statement] archetype.

Another issue is the `route` of administration.
In openEHR, the `route` of administration is optional (0..1) for each `medication_statement` EVENT.
However, in FHIR, this is part of the `dosage` element.
A single `MedicationStatement` in FHIR can have three different `dosages`,
each with a different `route` of administration.
For each unique `route` of administration, a new `medication_statement` EVENT must be created in openEHR.

The same logic applies when mapping from openEHR to FHIR.
In openEHR, each `EVENT` can contain a different medication,
whereas in FHIR, each `MedicationStatement` resource can only describe one medication.

image::MappingHierarchies.png[]

To summarize, if the `route` or `timing.event` appears multiple times in FHIR
with different values within the `dosage` element,
a new `EVENT` must be created in openEHR for each unique occurrence.
Similarly, if there are multiple medications in openEHR,
multiple `MedicationStatement` resources must be created in FHIR.

To enable this logic, hierarchy mappings are used.
These mappings must always be defined first in a FHIRconnect file
because they significantly impact the structure of the transformed files.
Hierarchy mappings include a `hierarchy` key at the level of the `with:` block.

This block contains two sub-blocks: one for FHIR and one for openEHR.
The `create:` key specifies the type of element to be created,
and the `path:` key indicates where this element should be created.
The `unique:` key defines the condition that triggers the creation of a new element.
The path in the `unique:` key relates to the `with:` block.

      fhir: "$resource.dosage"
      openEHR: "$archetype/data[at0001]/events[at0002]"
    #    type: "HIERARCHY" # Not necessary since hierarchy is a unique key for hierarchy mappings
    hierarchy:
      fhir:
        create: "resource"
        path: "$resource"
        unique: "['data[at0003]/items[openEHR-EHR-CLUSTER.medication.v2]/items[at0132]']"
