:navtitle: Mapping composition elements

Composition mappings are not an own layer of mapping. The concept of a Composition as it exists in openEHR
has no exact copy in FHIR. Fields contained in the Composition are contained in the resource instance. Therefore,
their mapping has to be contained there. Each project based mapping has to check, which composition level
mappings it inherits by the model mappings and has to overwrite those which it does not want.
